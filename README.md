Four-Kings
==========

Java card game

Similar to Solitaire but with little strategy and alot of luck (winning is quite hard). Finishing the game requires removing all the cards. you can
only remove a card from the table when it is active (the last card in the column) and another active card exists with the same
suit and a higher value. Active cards can be moved to empty spaces. If no legal moves are available then click the deck to deal
out some more cards.


All source code for the game is available as well as a jar file to play the application directly from the desktop.
